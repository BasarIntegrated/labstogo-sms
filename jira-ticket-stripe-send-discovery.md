# JIRA Ticket: Stripe Send Payment Discovery

## Ticket Details

**Project**: LabsToGo SMS - Message Blasting App  
**Issue Type**: Epic  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Components**: Payment Integration, SMS Campaign Management  
**Labels**: discovery, stripe, payments, sms-campaigns

---

## Summary

**Research and evaluate Stripe Send integration for SMS campaign payment processing**

---

## Description

### Background

The LabsToGo SMS application currently uses Twilio for SMS delivery but lacks a payment processing system. Users need a way to pay for SMS campaigns, and Stripe Send offers a compelling solution for sending money to recipients, which could be integrated with our SMS campaign workflow.

### Objectives

1. **Research Stripe Send capabilities** and how they align with our SMS campaign requirements
2. **Evaluate integration options** for payment processing within the existing Next.js/Supabase architecture
3. **Assess security and compliance** requirements for handling financial transactions
4. **Identify technical implementation** challenges and solutions
5. **Create implementation roadmap** if Stripe Send proves viable

### Current System Context

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Twilio SMS
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT-based auth with RBAC (Admin/Standard users)
- **Current Features**: SMS campaigns, contact management, message templates, dashboard analytics
- **Scale**: Designed for 50,000+ contacts with batch sending capabilities
