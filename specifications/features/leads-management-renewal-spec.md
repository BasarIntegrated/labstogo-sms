    stateData: LeadFilters | SelectedLeads;
  };
  transformations: {
    validation: validateLeadData;
    processing: processBulkOperations;
    formatting: formatForExport;
  };
  outputs: {
    displayData: ProcessedLead[] | AnalyticsCharts;
    apiRequests: LeadCRUD | BulkOperations | RenewalTracking;
    stateUpdates: LeadState | FilterState;
  };
}
```
