# Comprehensive Leads Management System Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive leads management system for the LabsToGo SMS Blaster application, specifically designed for handling renewal tracking, exam data, and bulk operations. The system will provide advanced lead management capabilities with analytics, segmentation, and automated workflows.

## Architecture Requirements

### Feature Components:

- Main feature component with complete functionality
- Supporting components for sub-features
- Custom hooks for state management
- Utility functions for data processing
- API integration layer

### Component Hierarchy:

```typescript
interface FeatureArchitecture {
  mainComponent: {
    name: string;
    props: Record<string, Type>;
    state: Record<string, Type>;
    children: Component[];
  };
  subComponents: Component[];
  hooks: Hook[];
  utilities: Function[];
  api: Endpoint[];
}
```

## Data Requirements

### Data Flow:

```typescript
interface DataFlow {
  inputs: {
    userInput: Type;
    apiData: Type;
    stateData: Type;
  };
  transformations: {
    validation: Function;
    processing: Function;
    formatting: Function;
  };
  outputs: {
    displayData: Type;
    apiRequests: Type;
    stateUpdates: Type;
  };
}
```

## API Requirements

### Endpoints:

- Complete API endpoint specifications
- Request/response contracts
- Error handling strategies
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting considerations

## UI/UX Requirements

### User Interface:

- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance
- Loading states and error handling
- User feedback mechanisms
- Consistent design system integration

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage:

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for data flow
- E2E tests for user journeys
- Performance tests for optimization
- Accessibility tests for compliance

## Files to Create/Modify:

### New Files:

- src/app/[feature]/page.tsx
- src/components/[feature]/[ComponentName].tsx
- src/hooks/use[Feature].ts
- src/lib/[feature].ts
- src/app/api/[feature]/route.ts
- **tests**/[feature]/\*.test.tsx

### Modify Existing:

- src/app/layout.tsx (if navigation changes)
- src/types/database.ts (if schema changes)

## Success Criteria:

- [ ] Feature works end-to-end
- [ ] All user interactions functional
- [ ] Responsive design implemented
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation complete
