# User Dashboard with Analytics Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive user dashboard with analytics for the LabsToGo SMS Blaster application. The dashboard will provide users with real-time insights into their SMS campaigns, lead management, and overall platform usage.

## Architecture Requirements

### Feature Components:

- Main feature component with complete functionality
- Supporting components for sub-features
- Custom hooks for state management
- Utility functions for data processing
- API integration layer

### Component Hierarchy:

```typescript
interface FeatureArchitecture {
  mainComponent: {
    name: string;
    props: Record<string, Type>;
    state: Record<string, Type>;
    children: Component[];
  };
  subComponents: Component[];
  hooks: Hook[];
  utilities: Function[];
  api: Endpoint[];
}
```

## Data Requirements

### Data Flow:

```typescript
interface DataFlow {
  inputs: {
    userInput: Type;
    apiData: Type;
    stateData: Type;
  };
  transformations: {
    validation: Function;
    processing: Function;
    formatting: Function;
  };
  outputs: {
    displayData: Type;
    apiRequests: Type;
    stateUpdates: Type;
  };
}
```

## API Requirements

### Endpoints:

- Complete API endpoint specifications
- Request/response contracts
- Error handling strategies
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting considerations

## UI/UX Requirements

### User Interface:

- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance
- Loading states and error handling
- User feedback mechanisms
- Consistent design system integration

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage:

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for data flow
- E2E tests for user journeys
- Performance tests for optimization
- Accessibility tests for compliance

## Files to Create/Modify:

### New Files:

- src/app/[feature]/page.tsx
- src/components/[feature]/[ComponentName].tsx
- src/hooks/use[Feature].ts
- src/lib/[feature].ts
- src/app/api/[feature]/route.ts
- **tests**/[feature]/\*.test.tsx

### Modify Existing:

- src/app/layout.tsx (if navigation changes)
- src/types/database.ts (if schema changes)

## Success Criteria:

- [ ] Feature works end-to-end
- [ ] All user interactions functional
- [ ] Responsive design implemented
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation complete
